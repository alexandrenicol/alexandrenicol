## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome, but I'm afraid that most of the public things in here are out of date and unmaintained.

You can learn a bit more about me on my personal website, https://alexnicol.dev; or on LinkedIn https://linkedin.com/in/alexnicol.

You can also watch me talk about [conversational systems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcVttSm3e8k) and [accessibility](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJwvY0K6TkY).
